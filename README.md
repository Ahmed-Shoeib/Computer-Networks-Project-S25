# MIU Computer Networks Project (CSC230) - Spring 2025

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the **Computer Networks Project (CSC230)** completed at **Misr International University** under the supervision of **Dr. Mostafa Abdelrahman**.  
The project demonstrates the design, implementation, and configuration of a complex enterprise network including **VLSM, VLANs, Routing Protocols, DHCP, NAT, VPN, and Wireless**.

---

## 🏗️ Project Objectives
The project is divided into 11 parts:

1. **VLSM Addressing Scheme** – Designing and implementing subnetting for VLANs and interconnections.  
2. **Basic Device Configuration** – Hostnames, passwords, SSH, and addressing.  
3. **Layer 2 Network Setup** – VLANs, trunking, Inter-VLAN routing, and EtherChannel.  
4. **Routing Protocols** – Configuring OSPFv2, EIGRP, and redistribution.  
5. **DHCP Server** – Centralized and relay-based DHCP.  
6. **NAT** – Dynamic NAT with PAT and static NAT.  
7. **Network Management** – NTP, Syslog, DNS, Web, and Email server configuration.  
8. **IPsec VPN** – Site-to-Site VPN between MIU and Branch.  
9. **Wireless Router** – SSID, WPA2, and client connectivity.  
10. **Connectivity Tests** – Ping, traceroute, routing tables, and IP interfaces.  
11. **Documentation** – Final detailed report with screenshots and troubleshooting steps.
